Write a neural network program to recognize the handwritten digits / alphabets by dividing
the characters as a set of edge segments and inputting the segments for classification

## Motivation

While convolutional neural networks are relativly well understood at a high level, and much of the research is in low level implementation details such as hardware or underlying algorithms generally abstracted away from users, as when most people think about convolutional or neural networks in general, thoughts usally go to PyTorch or Tensorflow or other such libraries. However, there is still much insight to be gained to be gained from understanding how they work at a higher level and trying to implement them without these higher level libraries as to really understand how they work it helps to delve right in the deep end. Aside from that, to understand why convolultional neural networks are used, it would be helpful to compare them to a traditional neural networks to compare the pros on cons of each one and see difference results each produces. This way metrics like accuracy, and resources like time and computational power can be compared.
